# 3DO
A set of tools for studying the onset of three-dimensionality in incompressible fluid flows. In particular, it includes
-	2D and 3D Navier-Stokes equations solver.
-	Floquet method to compute the patterns and growth rates of perturbations.
-	Algorithms to determine the most amplified perturbations in flow subregions.

_Parallel implementation: MPI._
